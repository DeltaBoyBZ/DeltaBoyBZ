By day, I am Matthew. By night, I am Delta Boy. 

My computing interests cover aspects of software design. 
In particular, I am interested in using data-tables as a replacement for hierarchical object-based models. 
This this end, I have the project [DOP-C](https://deltaboybz.github.io/dop-c).
I also have an older project [Tabular-C++](https://deltaboybz.github.io/tabular-cpp). 
I am also working on my first programming language, [Tabitha](https://deltaboybz.github.io/tabitha-sdk).

Privately, I have interests in graphics programming and general purpose GPU  (GPGPU) computing.
